## About Me

When not translating business needs into cloud solutions, I'm either pedaling up mountains, creating culinary masterpieces or pounding the piano keys to my neighbors' eternal despair.

### Professional Background

Currently working as Amazon Q Business Strategist & Builder in AWS Professional Services.
