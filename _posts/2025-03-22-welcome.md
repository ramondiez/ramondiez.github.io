### Mimicking Human Interactions

Welcome to my blog series where we'll explore how to build an agentic solution that mimics human daily interactions. In this series, we'll examine how complex human behaviors can emerge from simple rules of interaction between agents.
Each chapter will introduce a concept or feeling and I will provide its implementation, showing how agent-based models can represent human-like interactions while maintaining simplicity at their core.

Agent-based thinking, views social interactions as occurring when both parties prefer having them over not having them, with each seeking the form of interaction that ranks highest in their preferences.
This approach isn't limited to monetary exchanges between strangers but extends to scientific collaborations, romantic relationships, and commitments to voluntary organizations - all captured by the same logical framework.

As we progress through this series, we'll explore how agents can be designed with varying degrees of human-likeness, carefully selecting which features to faithfully match and which to deliberately omit.
We'll examine how people naturally attempt to "naturalize" unfamiliar agents by integrating them into their existing frameworks of knowledge and expectations.
This process of accommodation and adaptation reveals how humans test boundaries of commonly shared expectations to assign new entities a place within their familiar cognitive and practical order.

By understanding these dynamics, we can create agent-based models composed of decision-making heuristics, non-linear interaction topologies, and learning rules that generate complex emergent behaviors from simple foundations.

Join us as we decode the fascinating intersection of human behavior and artificial agency!
